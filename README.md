## K-Means-Clustering

Checked the null values if any and info about dataset using describe, here I checked about the spread using IQR and std. Using SSE, I drew "Elbow plot" where I got no of clusters = 3 where the SSE value decreases significantly and with this number I fit the KMeans model and estimate the position of centres and label the dataset with their relative category. Finally using lmplot, I drew the plot with all 3 clusters with their centroids.
